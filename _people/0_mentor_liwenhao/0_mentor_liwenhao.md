### BIO
I am a Tenure-Track Assistant Processor in the School of Software Engineering at the Tongji University. My research interests mainly include theoretical understanding, algorithmic improvements and practical application of AI agents, reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems and generative models.



I focus on developing robust, efficient, and practical decision-making algorithms. I am also interested in the application of (multi-agent) reinforcement learning and generative models in practical problems like multi-agent pathfinding, embodied AI and computational social science.



Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral fellow at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen supervised by Prof. Hongyuan Zha. I received my Ph.D. from the School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University in 2022, advised by Prof. Aimin Zhou and Prof. Hongyuan Zha. I received my B.E. from the School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University in 2016. During my Ph.D, I was a research intern in the Machine Learning Group at Tencent AI Lab advised by Dr. Dijun Luo. I was also a member of Tencent Rhion-Bird Talent Cultivation Program.



Please drop me an email if you are interested in collaborating with me.
